# research

This section of the LBRY project is for exploratory coding. Generally the prefered form is notebook (.ipynb) so that others can see the inputs and outputs of your explorations rather than having to run your code themselves. Of course, you can clone this code and play with it yourself. 

The current research thrust is around KPIs and transparency of the LBRY business by building business user readable metrics from the blockchain data. As this research matures, some elements may be integrated into the main LBRY project as APIs, and the general focus of the research Repo may evolve. Happy coding!
